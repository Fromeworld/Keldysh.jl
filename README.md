# Keldysh.jl

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/kleinhenz/Keldysh.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/kleinhenz/Keldysh.jl)

`Keldysh.jl` provides a set of tools for working with non-equilibrium Keldysh Green's functions.
It contains types to represent contours, grids defined on these contours, and two-time Green's functions defined on these grids.
Additionally, it provides functions for generating Green's functions, performing integration on a contour and hdf5 serialization.


Credit to Andrey Antipov and Igor Krivenko for designing a first version of the abstractions implemented here.

## Usage
The following code generates a non-equilibrium Green's function from a spectral density, saves it to an hdf5 archive and then loads it.
```
using Keldysh, HDF5

contour = twist(Contour(full_contour, tmax=1.0, Î²=5.0))
grid = TimeGrid(contour, npts_real=11, npts_imag=51)
dos = Keldysh.flat_dos(D=10.0)
gf = dos2gf(dos, grid)
h5write("output.h5", "/gf", gf)

gf_ = h5open("output.h5", "r") do h5f
  read(h5f["/gf"], TimeGF)
end

@assert gf_ == gf
```

See the `test` subdirectory for more examples.
